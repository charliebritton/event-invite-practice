# event-invite-practice
## About
This is a small practice project that I did to get my coding skills up *(and yes it may not be that good)* and the aims of the project were:
* Create a basic webpage with event name, date, time, location etc.
* Embed a google form to the page.
* Use a color scheme for the website (I used an image :P).
* Find a suitable google font.

You can find a working example of the website [here](https://charliebritton.github.io/event-invite-practive).

## Use Cases
This really serves no use with the way apple handles messages now although if you were sending an invite for something to your colleagues at work, an you still used email, then i suppose this could work.

## Licensing
The project is licensed under the [Unlicense License](http://unlicense.org "Unilicense Website") which means you can do whatever you like with this website.
